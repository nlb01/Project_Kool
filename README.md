# Project_Kool
  The main aim of the application is to provide foodies with recipes based on their favorite or available ingredients. 
The application suggests recipes based on an input of ingredientsand fetches the best matches for our users to make. 
Our foodies would also be able to share their own creations, as well as their suggestions to improve existing recipes.
